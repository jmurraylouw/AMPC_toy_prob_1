# AMPC_toy_prob_1
A MATLAB project to apply Data-driven system identification and AMPC to a toy problem.
So far I have applied Sys ID and AMPC to a mass spring damper with an input force tugging the mass.
I have also tested different Sys ID algorithms on a cart pendulum toy problem, including: DMDc, HAVOK, SINDy-PI, EKF, LS
